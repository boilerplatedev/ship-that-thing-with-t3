# ðŸš€ Ship that Thing Boilerplate

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` with some additional setup to make life easier.

- Login by Email Magic Link
- Custom NextAuth Pages (error, sign-in, sign-out, verify-request)
- Helpful `withAuth` and `withNoAuth` HOC's that any NextPage can be wrapped with to quickly lock/unlock any page.
  - `withNoAuth`: Used to make sure a logged in user can never go to these pages again. `src/pages/auth/sign-in` and `src/pages/auth/verify-request` are good examples.
  - `withAuth`: Used to make sure only logged in users can go to this page. `src/pages/auth/sign-out` is a good example.
- Sane Environment Variables + App level Config objects that use them to setup good defaults
- `Page` and `Container` layouts.
- `utils/cn`: a good helper utility that combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.
- [Convential commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages are setup via `commitlint` and `commitizen`. All the setup is done. If your commit messages don't follow that convention, it won't let you commit. Feel free to use another convention.
  - A helper NPM script `commit` has been added. Running `npm run commit` or `yarn commit` will help you craft good commit messages.

> + All the other features offered by the `T3 Stack` setup.
